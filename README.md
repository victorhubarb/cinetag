## Project Description
Cinetag is a dynamic movie-sharing platform built using React. This application allows users to browse a list of movies, mark favorites, and watch films through an integrated video player. Developed as a part of a learning initiative to deepen understanding of React's capabilities, the project leverages advanced features such as hooks, context, and routing to provide a rich and interactive user experience.

## Features
- **Interactive Movie List**: Users can view a curated list of movies, each displayed with a card layout. Movie cards include a clickable heart icon to favorite movies, enhancing user engagement.
- **Favorites Page**: Movies marked as favorites can be reviewed on a dedicated "Favorites" page, accessible via a link at the top right of the screen.
- **Video Playback**: Clicking on a movie card image directs users to a video player page where they can watch the movie. This feature uses dynamic routing to serve different content based on user interaction.
- **React Architecture**: Utilizes modern React practices, including functional components and hooks like `useState()` and `useEffect()` to manage state and side effects.
- **CSS Modules**: Styling is managed locally for each component using CSS Modules to encapsulate styles and avoid clashes across the global scope.
- **Advanced Routing**: Incorporates `react-router-dom` for handling dynamic and nested routes, allowing for multiple pages and a structured navigation experience.
- **Favorites Context**: Implements a context API to manage the state of favorite movies across different components of the application, demonstrating an advanced application of React's context.
- **Mock API**: Includes a mock API integration (`cinetag-api`) to simulate fetching data from a server, providing a realistic development environment for testing and demonstration.
